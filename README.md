# VAE for Hybrid Language Music Clustering

## Overview
This project implements an unsupervised learning pipeline using Variational Autoencoders (VAE) for clustering hybrid language music tracks. The goal is to extract latent representations from audio and lyrics then perform clustering. The results will be evaluated and compared with traditional methods such as K-Means and PCA.

## Project Goals
- Implement VAE for feature extraction from music data (audio + lyrics).
- Perform clustering using **K-Means** and compare it to baseline methods like PCA + K-Means.
- Visualize the clustering results using techniques like t-SNE or UMAP.
