        "   Strengths:\n",
        "   - Excellent at capturing spatial and temporal patterns unique to spectrograms (e.g., textures, harmonic structures).\n",
        "   - Learns hierarchical representations, abstracting raw audio into meaningful features.\n",
        "   - Effective at dimensionality reduction while retaining crucial information for audio.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Weaknesses:\n",
        "   - Ignores semantic content of lyrics, potentially missing context relevant to genre or mood.\n",
        "   - Might struggle with highly diverse audio patterns if not extensively trained.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. HYBRID VAE (Audio + Lyrics Features):\n",
        "   Strengths:\n",
        "   - Leverages complementary information from two distinct modalities (audio and text).\n",
        "   - Can potentially learn richer, more semantically meaningful latent representations by fusing audio and lyrical context.\n",
        "   - May be more robust to noise or ambiguities present in a single modality alone.\n",
        "   - Particularly useful for tasks where both sound and meaning are important (e.g., genre classification, content-based recommendation).\n",
        "\n",
        "   Weaknesses:\n",
        "   - Increased model complexity and computational cost compared to single-modality VAEs.\n",
        "   - Requires careful balancing of modal contributions to prevent one modality from dominating the other.\n",

        "3. PCA BASELINE (Note: PCA was not directly applied in this notebook for clustering but is a common baseline for feature comparison):\n",
